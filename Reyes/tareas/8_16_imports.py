# Using a program you wrote that has one function in it, store that function in a separate file. Import the function into your main program file, and call the function using each of these approaches:
    # import module_name
    # from module_name import function_name
    # from module_name import function_name as fn
    # import module_name as mn
    # from module_name import *

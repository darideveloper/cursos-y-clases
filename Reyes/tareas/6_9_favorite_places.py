# Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.

favorite_places ={
    'cris': ['cdmx', 'buenos aires', 'los angeles'],
    'carlos': ['caracas', 'tokyo', 'pekin'],
    'nani': ['la habana', 'moscu', 'berlin'],
}

for name, places in favorite_places.items():
    print (f"\n{name.title()} favorite places are:")
    for place in places:
        print (f"\t{place.title()}")

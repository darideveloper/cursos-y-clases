"""
Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to
visit.
•	 Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order.
•	 Print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list neatly,
just print it as a raw Python list.
•	 Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the
actual list.
•	 Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
•	 Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.
•	 Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
•	 Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its
order has changed.
•	 Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show
it’s back to its original order.
•	 Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the
list to show that its order has been changed.
•	 Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order.
Print the list to show that its order has changed.
